# Graduation Project in Differential Privacy

This is the gradutaion project of Davi Grossi Hasuda about differential privacy for ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica).

In this project, some of the machanisms to keep data private are implemented and analysed when using some of the most commom AI algorithms, such as Decision Tree, KNN and Machine Learning.

This project is oriented by Juliana de Melo Bezerra (http://www.comp.ita.br/~juliana/)

For this project, you can find some of the theorical resources in the `theory` folder. In the `documentation` folder, there is an explanation on how to use this repo. Finally, all the code (that was written in Python and also in Jupyter Notebooks) can be found in the `code` folder.
